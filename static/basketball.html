<h1>3rd Annual Maurice Morsette Memorial 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament</h1>
  <h2>Sunday May 9, 2010</h2>
  <h3>8:30 am - 12:00 pm</h3>

<b><i>Details coming soon.</i></b>

<!-----
  <p> The Stanford Powwow will be hosting the 2nd Annual Maurice Morsette Memorial 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament this year in honor of Maurice Morsette's Life.  Mo was a very dear member of the Stanford Community.  He was born April 6, 1987 in Minot, ND to Darian Morsette and Farrell Simmons.  Maurice was named Gi'iraba Shibisha, Black Buffalo Bull, and was a child of the Prairie Chicken Clan.  Throughout his life Mo was loving and thoughtful and always took care of his family and friends.  We hold this tournament in memory of Mo, because he greatly loved basketball.  </p> 
<p>This 3-on-3 tournament will be round robin style featuring 16 teams of 3-5 players per team (male or female). Teams will be placed into groups of four and given one game against each other team in their grouping, for a minimum of three 15-minute games, half-court games. Teams with the best record (or the largest margin of victory in the case of similar records) in each grouping will advance to an overall Final Four. Final Four winners will play in the tournament Championship.</p>

<p>The cost of the tournament is $50 per team, which will go to tournament costs and prizes. This will include a light breakfast for all members before play begins. All remaining proceeds will be donated to the "Dare to Dream: Maurice Morsette Scholarship" fund.</p>

<p>To register, download and submit a copy of <a href="http://stanford.edu/group/powwow/2ndAnnualBBallRegForm.doc">this Registration Form</a> for each team member, and a check for $50. (Mailing info on forms)</p>
